## Bits and bobs of stuff for Alexa development

#### Trivia

There are Easter Eggs in Alexa:

    "Alexa, tell me something"

For instance, according to Alexa:

    The word 'boredom' was first coined by Charles Dickens in his 1852 novel Bleak House.

So in a way, boredom was __invented__ by Charles Dickens. This may not come as a surprise
to anyone who has ever been required to read one of his very lengthy works!

(This is not a knock on Dickens: I have actually read Bleak House - and I wasn't required
to, so I guess I was reading for pleasure. My point is that actually requiring anyone to
read ___anything___ is probably a good way to make sure they don't enjoy the experience.
A better route to go is to ___ban___ the book; our library had a week of ___banned books___
once - and I was very surprised to find that I had aleady read at least half of them.
Catcher in the Rye, anyone?)
